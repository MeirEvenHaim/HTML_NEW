      <h1>A Short History of Cryptocurrencies</h1>

      <p>
        Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptography – a
        technique for encoding data to make it unreadable to anyone who lacks
        a password. Because of cryptography, cryptocurrencies are practically
        impossible to forge, though their security is also dependent on
        several other factors. Modern cryptocurrencies are decentralized
        systems based on blockchain technology. The blockchain is a
        distributed database structure first described by a cryptographer
        named David Chaum in his 1982 doctoral dissertation. In the crypto
        world, the blockchain serves as a public ledger of encrypted
        transactions that is maintained and updated by thousands of people all
        over the world. Transactions are anonymous but are publicly available.
        Bitcoin is not the first digital currency. It is not the first
        implementation of blockchain technology. It is not the first use of
        public key cryptography to keep data secure. But because all of these
        elements are assembled into a single system, it is the first modern
        cryptocurrency. Let’s take a quick look at the history of
        cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <h2>Before Bitcoin</h2>

      <p>
        Before the creation of Bitcoin, there were quite a few examples of
        online digital currencies, but none succeeded in attracting much
        interest or establishing themselves in financial markets. Two examples
        of such currencies are B-Money and Bit Gold.
      </p>
      <h2>2008: Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin</h2>
      <p>
        The internet domain bitcoin.org was registered in August 2008. It
        remains the homepage of the world’s most widely used cryptocurrency.
        On October 31 of the same year, a person or organization using the
        name Satoshi Nakamoto published a scientific paper titled Bitcoin: A
        Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. This paper is known in the crypto
        world as “Satoshi’s whitepaper.” The paper presented the concept of
        cryptographically secured blockchain technology. Bitcoin was described
        as a theoretical open-source digital resource. “Open source” meant
        that no one owned it and that everyone could participate in its use
        and development. To this day, no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
        His identity is subject to lots of myths and theories. It is possible
        that his identity will always remain unknown.
      </p>
      <h2>2009: Bitcoin Mining Begins</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2009 the Bitcoin software became available to the public for
        the first time. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first 50 Bitcoins, thus
        launching the practice of crypto mining. It was a time when only a
        small team of programmers and enthusiasts participated in the
        development of what few of them anticipated would one day be viewed as
        a groundbreaking technology.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1K_IiUV-Es&t=1s">this is an example
          video</a>
      </p>

      <h2>2010: Early Transactions</h2>
      <p>
        2010: Early Transactions It wasn’t realistic to attribute any real
        value to Bitcoin during its first year of existence. Developer Gavin
        Andresen bought 10,000 Bitcoins for $50 and created a website called
        Bitcoin Faucet where he literally donated Bitcoin for fun. The most
        famous tale from this era concerns Laszlo Hanyecz, a software
        developer who bought two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins. This is widely
        recognized as the very first cryptocurrency transaction. At Bitcoin’s
        peak price, those two pizzas would be worth well in excess of $600
        million. But Laszlo never regretted his decision. He believes it was a
        crucial step in establishing the growth of the crypto ecosystem. In
        December 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto posted his last public message to the
        popular online forum called bitcointalk. He wrote about some minor
        details about the latest version of the software. Afterwards, he
        remained in touch with some programmers via email, but there is no
        trace of him after April 2011.
      </p>
      <h2>2011: New Cryptocurrencies Are Born</h2>
      <p>
        On the wing’s of Bitcoin’s success, the idea of decentralized digital
        currencies slowly started to gain traction. As a result, the first
        alternative cryptocurrencies began to appear. Because these currencies
        were alternatives to the established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, they
        were known as altcoins. Most altcoins offer incremental improvements
        over the original Bitcoin protocol, features like greater speed,
        enhanced anonymity, and so on. Litecoin was among the first altcoins,
        which is why it is sometimes portrayed as the silver to Bitcoin’s
        gold. There are now thousands of cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <h2>2013: The First Big Bubble</h2>
      <p>
        In January 2013, the price of a single Bitcoin exceeded $1,000 for the
        first time. It was an important milestone, even if the price dropped
        quickly afterward and then stagnated for about two years before
        managing to hit the $1,000 mark again. Some early adopters suffered
        great losses during the price lull, and it caused a lot of negative
        press for Bitcoin. There was a lot of news coverage, and many people
        learned about cryptocurrency for the first time in the context of
        these lost fortunes. The crypto market grew slowly. It wasn’t clear
        how many of the alt coins would survive. Many didn’t.
      </p>

      <h2>2014: Mt. Gox and Turbulent Times</h2>
      <p>
        The market’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange was a website called Mt.
        Gox. In January 2014, it was hacked. The hackers got away with 850,000
        bitcoins. It still isn’t clear who was responsible for what remains
        the largest theft in crypto history. Critics said that because
        cryptocurrencies are based on anonymity and decentralization, it was
        no wonder it was hacked and that the hackers were impossible to trace.
        In November 2014, the founder of the Silk Road crypto website was
        sentenced to life imprisonment after illegal drugs were found to
        account for about 70% of the products sold via his website, which
        relied on Bitcoin to make sales to anonymous customers.
      </p>
      <h2>2015: Ethereum and the Altcoin Boom</h2>
      <p>
        The Ethereum project was launched in 2015. Some people think of it as
        the first truly useful implementation of the ideas underlying Bitcoin.
        Ethereum introduced smart contracts, a technology that allows the
        blockchain to host software programs in addition to crypto funds.
        Smart contracts enabled the development of complex, useful
        applications in finance and other areas.
        <br />

        In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum pioneered the notion of
        hosting multiple currencies. Although Ethereum had its own
        cryptocurrency, Ether, countless new token projects were implemented
        on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts and custom
        currencies proved a powerful combination for ambitious developers and
        entrepreneurs.
      </p>
      <h2>2017: Bitcoin reaches $20,000</h2>
      <p>
        The number of publicly available trading platforms and exchanges
        gradually increased, making it much easier to buy and sell
        cryptocurrencies. The explosion of ICOs intensified. All of this
        contributed to the rapid growth of the ecosystem. This young
        technology promised huge profits, and the total market capitalization
        of cryptocurrencies exceeded $800 billion dollars by the start of
        2018. It seemed like the only thing you needed to put a new company on
        the map was to make sure “crypto” or “blockchain” was part of its
        name.
      </p>
      <h2>2018: Back to Reality</h2>
      <p>
        The market’s growth was unsustainable, so in retrospect it seems
        inevitable that the bubble burst and prices began a step decline. Many
        projects collapsed as they were poorly conceived or too ambitious.
